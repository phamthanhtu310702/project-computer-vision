Object Detection with Swin Transformer backbone
## Techniques:
- Transferring on pre-trained model
- Backbone: Swin Transformers
## Details:
- DINO with SSL Swin backbone
- Apply mflow + ray + optuna for model selection
- Drift detector: 
    - maximum mean discrepancy 
    - untrained auto encoder and BBSDs
- hellp
