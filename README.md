Object Detection with Swin Transformer backbone
## Techniques:
- Transferring on pre-trained model
- Backbone: Swin Transformer/ Swinv2 Transformer
## Details:
- Detr with pre-trained Swin backbone
- Apply mflow + ray + optuna for model selection
- Drift detector: 
    - maximum mean discrepancy 
    - untrained auto encoder and BBSDs
